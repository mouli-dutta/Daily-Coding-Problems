# Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

# This problem was asked by Facebook.

# Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock once. You must buy before you can sell it.

# For example, given [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10], you should return 5, since you could buy the stock at 5 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars.

def max_profit(prices):
    if len(prices) < 2:
        return 0

    min_price = prices[0]
    max_profit = 0

    for price in prices[1:]:
        max_profit = max(max_profit, price - min_price)
        min_price = min(min_price, price)

    return max_profit


a = [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10]
print(max_profit(a))
